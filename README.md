# Hello-World-
The Pinnacle of all creations

Such a nice looking text editor
I always wanted one
I installed Brackets. By the time it opened, i could open and close multiple notepads. I wasn't very nice.
Then i installed Notepad++. It also take some time to load, but i can't seem to get myself to delete it.
I think i should install Atom. Or even Sublime text.

Life is sad. I am sad.
